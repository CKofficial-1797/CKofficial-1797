 ### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at NIT Jamshedpur, focused on building scalable full-stack applications and backend systems.
My work spans AI-powered SaaS platforms, REST-based microservices, and event-driven architectures, with an emphasis on clean system design, performance, and reliability.

I enjoy working on problems that involve distributed systems, backend architecture, and applied AI, and I actively build projects that reflect real-world engineering practices.
